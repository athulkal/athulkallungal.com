# About

Hello, I'm Athul Kallungal a passionate developer who loves to write programs in node.js, c#.
These are just some of my favourite languages. I'm currenly living in
London,United Kingdom.

This website is a personal blog which I use to document my learning journey as a self learn developer. You can have a look at my [blogs](/) or you can search by [category](/categories)

Apart from learning programming langauges and computer science, I'm
also intrigued about other human speaking languages and I'm currently
learning spanish because I find the language very interesting.

I also read a lot and I find it keeps me thinking and keeping my
mental sanity insight in this world where time goes so fast. I really
like the saying "A room without books is like a body without a soul."
some of my favourite reads are :

- Sapiens - A brief history of mankind
- The C# Programming Yellow Book
- The C programming language
- What Evey BODY is Saying
